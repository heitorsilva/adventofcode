## WHAT IS ADVENT OF CODE?

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

--- General Tips ---

If you get stuck, try your solution against the examples given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers. If not, re-read the description. Did you misunderstand something? Is your program doing something you don't expect? After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, build some test cases for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program. If you're still stuck, maybe ask a friend for help, or come back to the puzzle later. You can also ask for hints in the subreddit.

If you really think your solution is correct but your answer isn't accepted, and you think there might be a mistake in the puzzle itself because nobody else is solving it either (check the [stats](http://adventofcode.com/stats) page), let me know via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). My beta testers and I have checked the challenges pretty thoroughly, but it's still possible that there's an error somewhere.
